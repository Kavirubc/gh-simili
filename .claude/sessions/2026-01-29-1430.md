### Tasks Completed
- Session started
- Fixed issue #59: Empty string arguments from GitHub Actions
  - Modified cmd/gh-simili/main.go to filter out empty strings from os.Args
  - Empty strings were being passed when action.yml conditions evaluated to false
  - Verified compilation and tested with simulated empty string arguments

### Current Work

### Notes
- Fix prevents CLI parsing errors when GitHub Actions conditional expressions pass empty strings
- Tested with: `/tmp/gh-simili full-process "" --help ""` - correctly filtered empty strings
